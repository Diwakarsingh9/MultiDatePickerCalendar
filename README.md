# MultiDatePickerCalendar
We can use this project to select multiple dates in calendar


Just import the multipicker library in your project and add its calendar view in your required xml file.

Add all drawable files and color codes which are mentioned in my app's directory.

Note: I took the help from timessquare library, and did some changes.
